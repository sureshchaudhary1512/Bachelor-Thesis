# Bachelor Thesis Title - Design and Fabrication of all wheel Nut Runner for 100mm PCD 

This project aim is to design and fabrication of four wheel nut removing tool for tightening and removing of four nuts in one stroke. With the increment of number of car on the road, the number of cars problem due to tyre failure has increased. Often, the car is provided with tyre wheel nuts remover and jack for instance spare tyre replacement. Nevertheless, due to difficulty in applying torque to remove nut and to save a time. We develop tool having a gear planetary mechanism. In our project we are tried to focus on the minimization of human effort for fixing all for nuts of 100mm PCD wheel in one time. The main objective of work is to develop a single tool, which can be made use during assembling and disassembling of wheels in automobiles. It
can be successfully used as standard tool irrespective of the model of the vehicle. Also it can be used garages, workshops and service stations. The remover is designed to be ergonomic to be used, easy maintenance, easy storage, easy to handled and able to remove all nuts at once.


# Conclusion 

In this Project, the design and fabrication of multi nut removing tool is proposed. The static load analysis is performed. The fabrication of tool is completed by Shaping, welding and fitting processes. The tool is successfully manufactured and fully functional either tested manually using lever. From the results of analyses and experiments, the tool is possible to be improved and prototyped for mass production. For future development and improvement of the tool, light and strong material is expected to be available and applied.


#  Future scope 

1. Improvement in the system by making automatic operation with the help of pneumatic system which is clean and hazardous free.
2. To design and fabricate the complete assembly of the multiple operated spanner to be fitted to all vehicle wheels by adjusting pitch circle diameter by making pinion gear small or large as per wheelâ€Ÿs pitch circle diameter.
3. By replacing the motor with different gear arrangements in such manners that it can be operated manually by hand lever with less power requirement. The weight of the model can be reduced by using a light weight material of base plate.
4. It is also suggested to operate it with different gear arrangements with less power required.
