# Bachelor Thesis Title - Design and Fabrication of all wheel Nut Runner for 100mm PCD 

This project aim is to design and fabrication of four wheel nut removing tool for tightening and removing of four nuts in one stroke. With the increment of number of car on the road, the number of cars problem due to tyre failure has increased. Often, the car is provided with tyre wheel nuts remover and jack for instance spare tyre replacement. Nevertheless, due to difficulty in applying torque to remove nut and to save a time. We develop tool having a gear planetary mechanism. In our project we are tried to focus on the minimization of human effort for fixing all for nuts of 100mm PCD wheel in one time. The main objective of work is to develop a single tool, which can be made use during assembling and disassembling of wheels in automobiles. It
can be successfully used as standard tool irrespective of the model of the vehicle. Also it can be used garages, workshops and service stations. The remover is designed to be ergonomic to be used, easy maintenance, easy storage, easy to handled and able to remove all nuts at once.
